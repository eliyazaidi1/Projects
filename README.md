# Aircraft Path Simulator

Welcome to the Aircraft Path Simulator, a Python project that simulates and visualizes the flight path of an airplane based on user-input ranges.

## Overview

This project provides a simple yet interactive simulation of an airplane's path. Users can input specific parameters such as longitude,latitude,altitude and heading to observe the resulting flight trajectory.

## Features

- **Interactive Input:** Users can specify initial conditions including longitude,latitude,altitude and heading 
- **Path Visualization:** The simulated path is visualized , providing an intuitive representation of the airplane's journey.
- **Customizable Ranges:** Adjust parameters such as time duration or specific waypoints for a more tailored simulation.
